A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In the home page it was a challange to acheive the simultaneous scroll as griedview products and other widgets in singlechildscrollview both want to scroll separately. Ultimately I used customscrollview, slivers and slivergrid to achieve this.

Made local database model and created all the methods to made the cart interactive.
