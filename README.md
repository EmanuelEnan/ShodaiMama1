A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In the home page it was a challange to acheive the simultaneous scroll as griedview products and other widgets in singlechildscrollview both want to scroll separately. Ultimately I used customscrollview, slivers and slivergrid to achieve this.

In the API request i made a mistake by not putting 's' after the 'HTTP'. Spent a lot of times there as everything was fine and i didn't notice that mistake.

Made local database model and created all the methods to made the cart interactive. Unfortunately I couldnt able to do it as whenever i used the consumer method the FutureBuilder couldn't able to fetch the data and API request gets continous loading.
